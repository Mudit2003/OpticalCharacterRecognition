# Text detection

The sample training script was made to train text detection model with docTR.

## Setup

First, you need to install `doctr` (with pip, for instance)

```shell
pip install -e . --upgrade
pip install -r references/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can start your training in TensorFlow:

```shell
python references/detection/train_tensorflow.py path/to/your/train_set path/to/your/val_set db_resnet50 --epochs 5
```

or PyTorch:

```shell
python references/detection/train_pytorch.py path/to/your/train_set path/to/your/val_set db_resnet50 --epochs 5 --device 0
```

## Data format

You need to provide both `train_path` and `val_path` arguments to start training.
Each path must lead to folder with 1 subfolder and 1 file:

```shell
├── images
│   ├── sample_img_01.png
│   ├── sample_img_02.png
│   ├── sample_img_03.png
│   └── ...
└── labels.json
```

Each JSON file must be a dictionary, where the keys are the image file names and the value is a dictionary with 3 entries: `img_dimensions` (spatial shape of the image), `img_hash` (SHA256 of the image file), `polygons` (the set of 2D points forming the localization polygon).
The order of the points does not matter inside a polygon. Points are (x, y) absolutes coordinates.

labels.json

```shell
{
    "sample_img_01.png" = {
        'img_dimensions': (900, 600),
        'img_hash': "theimagedumpmyhash",
        'polygons': [[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]], ...]
     },
     "sample_img_02.png" = {
        'img_dimensions': (900, 600),
        'img_hash': "thisisahash",
        'polygons': [[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]], ...]
     }
     ...
}
```

If you want to train a model with multiple classes, you can use the following format where polygons is a dictionnary where each key represents one class and has all the polygons representing that class.

labels.json

```shell
{
    "sample_img_01.png": {
        'img_dimensions': (900, 600),
        'img_hash': "theimagedumpmyhash",
        'polygons': {
            "class_name_1": [[[x10, y10], [x20, y20], [x30, y30], [x40, y40]], ...],
            "class_name_2": [[[x11, y11], [x21, y21], [x31, y31], [x41, y41]], ...]
        }
    },
    "sample_img_02.png": {
        'img_dimensions': (900, 600),
        'img_hash': "thisisahash",
        'polygons': {
            "class_name_1": [[[x12, y12], [x22, y22], [x32, y32], [x42, y42]], ...],
            "class_name_2": [[[x13, y13], [x23, y23], [x33, y33], [x43, y43]], ...]
        }
    },
    ...
}
```
